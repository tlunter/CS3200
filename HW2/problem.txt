Consider an online web application that allows developers to collaborate to create various types of applications.

They can create web, mobile, or desktop applications.
Web applications can be accessed through a URL, have a name, the date it was created, price per access, and have a target browser.
Mobile applications have a target mobile OS, a name, times it has been installed, and the date it was created.
Desktop applications have a target OS, name, price per download, date it was created.

A developer can work on several applications in various capacities or roles.
On one application they might work on the user experience, on another they might be a project manager, on another they might be a business analyst, architect, database admin, back end developer, or a front end developer.
They might have various roles for the same application.

In general, applications consists of three distinct parts: views, controllers, and models.

A view is used to display data in the model and can be composed of other views.
A view can have several event handlers that are used to invoke scripts in the controller.

A controller is composed of a set of scripts that execute when an event occurs in the view.
Scripts can manipulate data in the model.
The result of the script defines what the next view will be.

A model consists of a set of name value pairs.
A value can be a string, number, date, or set of name value pairs.
